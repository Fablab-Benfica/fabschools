### Education

Education is a key asset to train successful future innovators.

Children will learn about coding, robotics and arts while using mobile devices in educational settings. Learn about photography: framing, white balance, temperature, film sensibility, exposure, shutter speed.

### Sustainability

The project uses a lot of electronic components that can be used in other projects.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDGâ€™s)

* 4 - Quality Education
* 9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure

### Openness

All the files and plans are available online and the community is encouraged to collaborate and adapt to their own necessities.

### Ecosystem

Children can build, code and photograph their robot. At school, teachers can use this project to teach and enable colaborations between subjects (arts and ICT).Parents: can be co-creators at home and encourage the exploration of the relation of creativity with mobile devices.

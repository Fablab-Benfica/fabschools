### Education

Caleiduino is adaptable to be used in elementary and middle schools as well as used for workshops and free play. It is a project that explores different topics such as electronics, programming, sound and graphics. The use context should be adapted to the main topic that is supposed to be addressed.

### Sustainability

Most of the materials have to be bought beforehand and it uses some specific electronic parts that may have to be imported. The electronics may be used for other future projects though. As long as the parts are available, it can be assembled locally following digital guides provided online.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDG’s)

* 4 - Quality Education
* 9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure

### Education

It is a product that allows children to learn with their bodies, hands, using all their senses. They will learn about volume, space, structure, materials in an embodied form.

### Sustainability

It is designed to be created from used cardboard boxes that already served their purpose and are ready to be given a new life. When the project is not needed anymore, it can be easily recyclable.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDG’s)

* 4 - Quality Education
* 10 - Reduced Inequalities

### Openness

There are other similar commercial products but this building system is open source and can be easily expanded and improved with new forms and shapes.

### Ecosystem

Parents can help and give ideas for better or more complex constructions. At school, children can build together. The teacher can give ideas of how to improve children's work. At the FabLab, makers can improve the system adding different materials, more (compatible) sizes.

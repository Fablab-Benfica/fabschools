### Education

Ask the Checkers is based on the same checkers guidelines. They are groups of two, each group must have a checkerboard and 24 round pieces. The difference is in knowing the other through questions. Each time a player advances the player can ask a question. As the player advances, more and more questions are asked and the barriers between kids start to crumble. This activity works memory, communication and promotes socialization.

### Sustainability

All the materials and techniques used are sustainable.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDG’s)

### Openness

All the files needed are available online and a lesson is hosted on Scopes-DF. Can be produced using thin wood or even cardboard.

### Ecosystem

The game is ready to be crafted in a FabLab using a laser cutter. It can be used in different contexts as a way to encourage groups of unknown kids meet each other and get to know themselves.

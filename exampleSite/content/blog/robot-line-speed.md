### Education

Get hands-on and learn how to assemble and program a Robot based on Arduino to follow lines in the ground. A great lesson for kids to start exploring the potential of Arduino. 

### Sustainability

The Arduino and all the electronic components can be reused for creating new projects in the future.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDGâ€™s)

* 4 - Quality Education
* 9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure

### Openness

All files are available online. Wikifactory hosts the plans necessary to build and code the product.

### Ecosystem

The project is easier to do in a FabLab context. Access to a laser cutter is needed and assembling the electronics is easier with help from a more experienced adult.

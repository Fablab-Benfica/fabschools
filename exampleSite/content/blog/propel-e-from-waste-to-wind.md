### Education

The project can be used to teach about several topics such as electricity, renewable energy, sustainability or digital fabrication.

### Sustainability

With our wind turbines, we aim to reduce the waste problem step by step. Our wind turbines are 3D-printed bioplastics like PLA. We are also migrating away from rare-earth magnets towards ferrite magnets. In this way we reduce the need for polluting mining practices and unhealthy manufacturing conditions.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDG’s)

* 4 - Quality Education
* 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy
* 9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure
* 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities
* 12-  Responsible Consumption and Production
* 13 - Climate Action

### Openness

All the materials needed, plans and guides are available online.

### Ecosystem

Elaborating on the work of Precious Plastics, Scoraig Wind, Otherpower, and many more from the DIY- and maker community, Propel-E doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but adds on known and tested designs. It is designed to be manufactured in a FabLab context and to be applied anywhere else.

Let’s face it — people are gonna touch their faces. Sometimes faces itch, especially during allergy season. But the first step toward quitting something like that is to become cognizant of just how often you do it.

### Education

A great way to introduce kids to block based coding and 3D printing. Also a useful project to remind kids about the rules to stop spreading the virus as much as possible!

### Sustainability

The electronics needed are ready to be used for your future projects once this one is not needed anymore!

#### SDG Profile (selected SDG’s)

* 4 - Quality Education

### Openness

In an effort to gain the upper hand over the virus, we just mixed a couple of ingredients in our magic blender: Adafruit's Circuit Playground Express, Adafruit's MakeCode, some 3D printing and... voilá. All files are available online. Wikifactory hosts the plans necessary to build and code the product.

### Ecosystem

The product itself paired with a guided lesson from an educator/teacher aims to help children to develop this kind of person/object thinking, making their minds think about how they interact with objects and encouraging them to create 'expressive new interactions with the world around them'.

All the parts can be prepared at a FabLab and assembled together anywhere else.

### Education

This is a resource that helps children understand abstract concepts related to arithmetic in an embodied, playful way. Reduces children's workload by externalizing physically abstract properties of numbers. It is a very effective game that it is also easy and cheap to produce.

### Sustainability

It has been designed so that it can be easily downloaded from the Internet. It can also be printed at very low cost since it just needs a little bit of black ink and colored A4 paper.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDG’s)

* 4 - Quality Education
* 10 - Reduced Inequalities

### Openness

All the files necessary are available online. The project is open to new approaches and there is room for the imagination of everyone to help kids really understand math and make this product more complete.

### Ecosystem

Parents, older brothers, other kids can play the board game with smaller children and offer alternative solutions (so that kids understand that math is not just about one correct answer). In school, the whole class can play together with the teacher and then create groups of four to play together. The project is also very effective with autistic children.

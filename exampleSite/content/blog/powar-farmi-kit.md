### Education

POWAR works as a STEAM educational toy, since kids can design it, code it, build it, design or modify the electronics, test with different plants, learn about climate change, biology, electronics, physics, math, design and fabrication tools.

### Sustainability

POWAR is meant to be a DIY, easy to use and experiment climate simulator, so people can experiment about what will happen with the plants they are growing nowadays, with their future predicted weather, so they can anticipate and try to find solutions to what is about to come.

#### SDG Profile (selected SDGâ€™s)

* 4 - Quality Education
* 9 - Industry Innovation and Infrastructure
* 10 - Reduced Inequalities
* 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities
* 12 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure
* 13 - Climate Action
* 15 - Life on land

### Openness

POWAR is entirely open-source all materials are available online ready for usage.

### Ecosystem

POWAR is a perfect tool for kids, school and parents to teach STEAM education to kids in any level, since it can be used to teach more complicated things like coding, electronic or digital fabrication to kids, and it can be built in any maker space... to more simple things like the effects of sunlight and water in the process of growing a plant to smaller kids.
